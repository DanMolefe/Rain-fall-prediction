# Rain-fall-prediction

**Goal:** Use machine learning methods **LogisticRegression, XGBClassifier, SVC, and RandomForestClassifier** with rainfall data to predict rainfall using data with variables listed below. 

**Pressure:** The force exerted on a surface per unit area, often referring to atmospheric pressure. It’s the weight of the air above us and can affect weather conditions. In meteorology, low pressure is associated with stormy weather, while high pressure generally leads to clear skies.

**MaxTemp:** Short for maximum temperature, this refers to the highest temperature reached during a specific period, like a day or a season.

**Temperature:** The measure of how hot or cold something is. In weather terms, it’s how warm or cold the air is, often measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit.

**MinTemp:** Short for minimum temperature, it represents the lowest temperature reached in a specific time frame, such as during the night or a given day.

**Dewpoint:** The temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture and water vapor begins to condense. When the air temperature drops to the dew point, fog or dew can form. It gives an indication of humidity.

**Humidity:** The amount of water vapor present in the air. It’s typically expressed as a percentage. High humidity can make it feel hotter, while low humidity can make the air feel cooler.

**Cloud:** A visible mass of condensed water vapor suspended in the atmosphere. Clouds come in various types, such as cumulus (fluffy) or stratus (layered), and play a role in weather patterns, including precipitation.

**Rainfall:** The amount of rain that falls over a particular area, often measured in millimeters or inches. *(yes=rain and no=no rain)*

**Sunshine:** The sunlight that reaches the Earth. It’s an indicator of how much of the sun’s rays are visible at a given location and time. More sunshine generally means clearer skies and warmer temperatures.

**Winddirection:** The direction from which the wind is blowing, typically measured in degrees (where 0° is north, 90° is east, etc.). It gives insight into weather patterns and can indicate changes in weather conditions.

**Windspeed:** The rate at which the wind is moving, usually measured in kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph). Higher wind speeds can signify storms or rough weather conditions.
